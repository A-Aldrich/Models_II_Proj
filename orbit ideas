Orbit Path Calculator

Conditions
  Fuel amount
  Engine
  Firing angle
  Payload kg
  Planet
  
Things that happen
  Mass calculated depending on fuel left
  velocity and acceleration calculated based on mass
  test if rocket makes escape velocity
  stop if fuel expended accelerating

Results
  Orbit?
  if so what apogee/perigee and each velocity 
  Fuel left
  
Stages maybeeeeeeeeeeee
  Burn/wait
  angle relative to rocket
  for t secodns
